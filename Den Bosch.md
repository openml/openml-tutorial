## Choose your Jupyter environment 
There are several options:
* JADS Jupyter environment
    - [Download](https://github.com/openml/openml-tutorial/archive/master.zip) (or clone) this github repository. Locate the `notebook` folder.
    - In your JADS Jupyter environment, create a new folder, click the upload button, and upload *everything* from the `notebook` folder into that new folder
    - Open and run the `Python setup` notebook to install all dependencies
    - Verify that everything installs correctly
    
* Binder
    - Click the Binder button on the website to start a new environment on myBinder. This will start a docker image, so it may take a few minutes.

* Google Colab
    - We provided links to Google Colab notebooks on the website. You need to make your own copy of each of them via File > Save Copy in Drive

* Set up your own environment
    - OpenML part: Instructions are available in the beginning of the OpenML Python tutorial
    - AutoML part: Do the setup as in the Python setup notebook. Note: Autosklearn does NOT run on Windows
    
## Preparation
* Create an OpenML account on [http://www.openml.org](openml.org) - this is needed for uploading things to the platform
* If you have interesting data to work with, please bring it along.
    - Open datasets can be shared during the hands-on session. 
    - Any canonical machine learning problems (classification/regression) can be experimented with during the AutoML hands-on session.
